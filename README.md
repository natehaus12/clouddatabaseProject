# Overview

I really wanted to learn how to interact with and use databases, so I made a simple database project.

This program allows you to add to, delete from, modify, and query from a database containing your name and
favorite football team

# Cloud Database

I used google firebase and cloud firestore

The database has one collection titled "people" it the adds documents with the users' name that contains a field of their favorite team.

# Development Environment

I used VS code and the google firebase website to complete this project.

The program is written in python. I had to import a few firebase libraries and the os library

# Future Work

* Add more fields
* Aleter the display of the query
* Allow people to ave mulitple favorite teams.
